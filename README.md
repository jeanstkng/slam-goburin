# Slam Goburin
Developed by JeanStkng

A simple game based on Vampire Survivors done using HTML and JavaScript, powered by Vite.

**Resources:**
- Viking sprites from: https://pellaore.itch.io/viking-character
- PixelifySans font from: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pixelify+Sans
- Bullet and Goblin by JeanStkng, not really useful but if you need it, use it

If you want to upload the build to some kind of hosting, you might have to change all imported resources in html, css and javascript to be absolute imports, it is just putting a dot before assets in html and js files like /assets/... to ./assets/... but in css for font while using url() just import directly the file i.e.: url(PixelifySans-Regular-6aa2cfe8.ttf)
